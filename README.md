# My_Software_Project_OpenCV
In this project I will connect my main camera and start to detect objects( whoever is in front of the camera). Many of the people who work in offices spend all day sitting in the same spot. The idea of ​​this project is to try to get the object ( In this case yourself ) to be as straight as possible and take care of your back a little more with this.  Once you are  sitting in a comfortable position, with your back straight. The camera will check your shoulder landmarks and face and will detect if you are  in the correct position, as the minutes go by your back generally begins to curve, what this will do is tell you that you are getting out of line. In this way, we are going to pay more attention to the posture of our back or we are going to get up and take a break and stretch well.


THE CODE IS NOT FINISHED , STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT HOW TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CAMERA AND THE OBJECT IN FRONT.
